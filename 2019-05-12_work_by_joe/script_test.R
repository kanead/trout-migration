#' write one script that produces one dataframe 

## Load libraries:
libraries <- c("RNetLogo", "ggplot2", 
               "tidyverse", "Hmisc")
for (lib in libraries) {
        if (require(package = lib, character.only = TRUE)) {
                print("Successful")
        } else {
                print("Installing")
                source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
                biocLite(pkgs = lib)
                library(lib, character.only = TRUE )
        }
}
